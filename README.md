# Python Tools for SAS Viya

The pyviyatools are a set of command-line tools that call the SAS Viya REST API's from python. The tools can be used to make direct calls to any rest-endpoint (like a CURL command) or to build additional tools that make multiple rest calls to provide more complex functionality. The tools are designed to be used in conjunction with the sas-admin command line interfaces(CLI).

## Getting Started

### Documentation

You can find the SAS Open API's documented: https://developer.sas.com/apis/rest/ 

Some other useful links

* https://developer.sas.com/apis/rest/#filters
* https://developer.sas.com/apis/rest/#pagination
* https://developer.sas.com/apis/rest/#sorting

### Prerequisites

The tools requires either python 2 or python 3.

The following python libraries are used:

* requests http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/
* sys
* json
* os
* netrc
* subprocess
* platform
* argparse


### Installing

Please use the installation intructions in the file INSTALL.md  [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) 

### Running

The pyviya tools use the sas-admin auth CLI to authenticate to Viya. To use the tool you must create a profile and authenticate. 

This process is documented in the SAS Viya Administration guide here:  
Viya 3.3: http://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=calcdc&cdcVersion=3.3&docsetId=calcli&docsetTarget=n1e2dehluji7jon1gk69yggc6i28.htm&locale=en  
Viya 3.4: http://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=calcdc&cdcVersion=3.4&docsetId=calcli&docsetTarget=n1e2dehluji7jon1gk69yggc6i28.htm&locale=en  

#### Creating a Profile and Logging on

The tool will automatically use the default profile.
 
1. To create a profile as a SAS Administrator logon to the machine that contains the Viya CLI's 
2. Run */opt/sas/viya/home/bin/sas-admin profile init* and when prompter enter the base endpoint of your Viya server for example: http://myviyaserver.blah.com. You may enter your personal preference at the other prompts. 
3. After you create the profile there are two options to authenticate
 * Run */opt/sas/viya/home/bin/sas-admin auth login* to authenticate to Viya enter the userid and password of the SAS Administrator when prompted.
 *  Create an .authinfo file in your home directory with your userid and password and use **loginviauthinfo.py** to authenticate with the credentials in the file (you can use different authinfo files with the -f option) 

The CLI allows for multiple profiles. To use a profile other than the default profile, for example newprofile

1. Create a named profile *sas-admin --profile newprofile profile init*
2. Logon with the named profile *sas-admin --profile newprofile auth login*
3. Set the SAS_CLI_PROFILE environment variable to the name of the profile 
* LINUX: *export SAS_CLI_PROFILE=newprofile*
* WINDOWS: *set SAS_CLI_PROFILE=newprofile*

4. When the  SAS_CLI_PROFILE is set the tool will use the profile stored in the variable
5. To revert to using the default variable reset the environment variable

* LINUX: *unset SAS_CLI_PROFILE*
* WINDOWS: *set SAS_CLI_PROFILE=*


The tools are self-documenting, for help on any tool call the tool passing -h or --help. 

python *\<pathtotool\>\<toolname.py\>* -h


**Available Tools**

**callrestapi** 

callrestapi is a general tool, and the building block for all the other tools.

callrestapi  will call the Viya REST API and return json or optionally a simplified output. It can call any viya REST method. (Like a curl command).

*usage: callrestapi.py [-h] -e ENDPOINT -m {get,put,post,delete} [-i INPUTFILE]  [-a ACCEPTTYPE] [-c CONTENTTYPE] [-o {csv,json,simple}]*
          
You must pass a method and endpoint. You can optionally pass json, content type headers or the -t flag to change output from json to basic text.

**List of some of the Additional Tools Available**

Additional tools provide more complex functionality by combining multiple calls to the callrestapi function, and post-processing the outpuit that is returned.

* **getfolderid** returns the id of the folder based on the full folder path
* **deletefolder** deletes a folder based on the full folder path
* **deletefolderandcontent** deletes a folder and any reports that are stored in the folder
* **movecontent** moves the content from a source to a target folder
* **getconfigurationproperties** lists the name/value pairs of a configuration
* **testfolderaccess** tests if a user or group has access to a folder
* **createbinarybackup.py** creates a binary backup job
* **createdomain.py** creates an authentication domain
* **listrules.py** list authorization rules subset on a principal and/or a uri
* **loginviauthinfo.py** use an authinfo file to authenticate to the CLI
* **updateprefences.py** update preferences for a user or group of users
* **updatedomain.py** Load a set of userids and passwords to a Viya domain from a csv file
* **createfolders.py** Create a set of Viya folders from a csv file 
* **explainaccess.py** Explains access for a folder, object or service endpoint
* **getpath.py** Return path of folder, report, or other object in folder
* **listmemberswithpath.py** lists members of a folder, recursively if desired

## Examples

The example calls assume you are in the directory where you installed the tools. If you are not you can prepemd the directory to the filename, for example /opt/pyviyatools/callrestapi.py
If you are using the tool on windows the syntax is:

*python toolname.py*

The following examples are Linux.

\# Login to Viya using default authinfo file ~/.authinfo  
*./loginviauthinfo.py*

\# Login to Viya using an authinfo file  
*./loginviauthinfo.py -f ~/.authinfo_geladm*

\#return all the rest calls that can be made to the folders endpoint  
*./callrestapi.py -e /folders -m get*  

\#return the json for all the folders/folders  
*./callrestapi.py -e /folders/folders -m get*  

\#return simple text for all the folders/folders  
*./callrestapi.py -e /folders/folders -m get -o simple* 

\#rest calls often limit the results returned the text output will tell you returned and total available items   
\#in this call set a limit above the total items to see everything  
*./callrestapi.py -e /folders/folders?limit=500 -m get -o simple*  


\#return the json for all the identities  
*./callrestapi.py -e /identities/identities -m get*    

\#return the json for all the identities output to a file  
*./callrestapi.py -e /identities/identities -m get > identities.json*    

\#refresh the identities cache  
*./callrestapi.py -e /identities/userCount -m get*    
*./callrestapi.py -e /identities/cache/refreshes -m post*    

\# pass the folder path and return the folder id and uri  
*./getfolderid.py -f /gelcontent*  

\# delete a folder based on its path   
*./deletefolder.py -f /gelcontent*  

\#return a set of configuration properties  
*./getconfigurationproperties.py -c sas.identities.providers.ldap.user -o simple*  

\#create a domain using createdomain  
*./createdomain.py -t password -d test -u sasadm -p lnxsas -g "SASAdministrators,HR ,Sales"* 

\#Update an existing domain to add credentials from a csv file   
*./updatedomain.py -d LASRAuth -f /tmp/myusers.csv* 

csv file format  
no header row  
column1 is userid  
column2 is password  
column3 is identity    
column4 is identity type (user or group)  

For example:  
myuserid,mypass,Sales,group   
acct1,pw1,sasadm,user  

\#create a domain using callrestapi. Last part of endpoint is domain name
*./callrestapi.py -e /credentials/domains/\<newdomain\> -m post -i domain.json*  

INPUT JSON must be formatted as the endpoint expects. Example:  

{   
  "id": "\<newdomain\>",  
  "type": "password"  
}  

\#test folder access  
*./root/admin/pyviyatools/testFolderAccess.py -f '/gelcontent' -p Sales -m read -s grant -q*  
 
\#return basic content using accept response type    
*./callrestapi.py -m get -e /identities/users/sasadm -a "application/vnd.sas.identity.basic+json"*

\# Display all sasadministrator rules  
*./listrules.py --p SASadministrators -o simple*

\# Display all rules that contain SASVisual in the URI  
*./listrules.py -u SASVisual -o simple*

\# Create folders from a CSV file  
*./createfolders.py" -f /tmp/newfolders.csv*

FORMAT OF CSV file folder path (parents must exist), description  
/RnD, Folder under root for R&D  
/RnD/reports, reports  
/RnD/analysis, analysis  
/RnD/data plans, data plans  
/temp,My temporary folder  
/temp/mystuff, sub-folder  

\# Update the theme for the user sasadm  
*./updatepreferences.py -t user -tn sasadm -pi  OpenUI.Theme.Default -pv sas_hcb*


\#Explain direct and indirect permissions on the folder /folderA/folderB, no header row. For folders, conveyed permissions are shown by default.  
*./explainaccess.py -f /folderA/folderB*

\#As above but for a specific user named Heather  
*./explainaccess.py -f /folderA/folderB -n Heather -t user*

\#As above with a header row  
*./explainaccess.py -f /folderA/folderB --header*

\#As above with a header row and the folder path, which is useful if you concatenate sets of results in one file  
*./explainaccess.py -f /folderA/folderB -p --header*

\#As above showing only rows which include a direct grant or prohibit  
*./explainaccess.py -f /folderA/folderB --direct_only*

\#Explain direct and indirect permissions on a service endpoint. Note in the results that there are no conveyed permissions. By default they are not shown for URIs.  
*./explainaccess.py -u /SASEnvironmentManager/dashboard*

\#As above but including a header row and the create permission, which is relevant for services but not for folders and other objects   
*./explainaccess.py -u /SASEnvironmentManager/dashboard --header -l read update delete secure add remove create*

\#Explain direct and indirect permissions on a report, reducing the permissions reported to just read, update, delete and secure, since none of add, remove or create are applicable to a report.   
*./explainaccess.py -u /reports/reports/id --header -l read update delete secure*

\#Explain direct and indirect permissions on a folder expressed as a URI. Keep the default permissions list, but for completeness we must also specify -c true to request conveyed permissions be displayed, as they are not displayed by default for URIs.   
*./explainaccess.py -u /folders/folders/id --header -p -c true*

\# Get folder path for an object (can be a folder, report or any other object which has a folder path)  
*./getpath.py -u /folders/folders/id*  
*./getpath.py -u /reports/reports/id*  

\# Return list of members of a folder identified by objectURI  
*./listmemberswithpath.py -u /folders/folders/id*  

\# Return list of all members of a folder identified by objectURI, recursively searching subfolders  
*./listmemberswithpath.py -u /folders/folders/id -r*

**Troubleshooting**

The most common problem is an expired access token. You may see a message like:

    {"errorCode":0,"message":"Cannot convert access token to JSON","details":["traceId: 6bca23b2b3a2cfda","path: /folders/folders"],"remediation":null,"links":[ ],"version":2,"httpStatusCode":401}

To fix the problem generate a new access token /opt/sas/viya/home/bin/sas-admin auth login 

To see the current setup, including python and package versions, environment variable settings, profile information and current user. Run

*python showsetup.py*

If you get this error : Login failed. Error with security certificate.

Set the environment variable for the SSL certificate file. For example:
export SSL_CERT_FILE=/opt/sas/viya/config/etc/SASSecurityCertificateFramework/cacerts/trustedcerts.pem


If you get this error:
Raise SSLError(e, request=request)
requests.exceptions.SSLError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='intviya01.race.sas.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: / (Caused by SSLError(SSLError(1, u'[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed (_ssl.c:579)'),))

Set the environment variable for the SSL certificate file. For example:
export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/opt/sas/viya/config/etc/SASSecurityCertificateFramework/cacerts/trustedcerts.pem


## Developing with the existing functions

The file sharedfunctions.py contains a set of generic functions that make it easy to build additional tools.

*callrestapi* is the main function, called by many other programs and by the callrestapi program to make the REST calls. It accepts as parameters:

* reqval: the request value which is the rest endpoint for the request
* reqtype: the type of REST request, get,put, post, delete
* acceptType: optinal accept type content header
* contentType: optional content type content header
* data: optionally a python dictionary created from the json for the rest request
* stoponerror: whether the function will stop all further processing if an error occurs (default 0 to not stop)
