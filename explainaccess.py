# explainaccess.py
# November 2018
#
# Usage:
# explainaccess.py [-f folderpath | -u objectURI] [-n name_of_user_or_group -t user|group] [-p] [--header] [--direct_only] [-l permissions_list] [-c true|false] [-d]
#
# Examples:
#
# 1. Explain direct and indirect permissions on the folder /folderA/folderB, no header row. For folders, conveyed permissions are shown by default.
#        ./explainaccess.py -f /folderA/folderB
#
# 2. As 1. but for a specific user named Heather
#        ./explainaccess.py -f /folderA/folderB -n Heather -t user
#
# 3. As 1. with a header row
#        ./explainaccess.py -f /folderA/folderB --header
#
# 4. As 1. with a header row and the folder path, which is useful if you concatenate sets of results in one file
#        ./explainaccess.py -f /folderA/folderB -p --header
#
# 5. As 1. showing only rows which include a direct grant or prohibit
#        ./explainaccess.py -f /folderA/folderB --direct_only
#
# 6. Explain direct and indirect permissions on a service endpoint. Note in the results that there are no conveyed permissions.
#    By default they are not shown for URIs.
#        ./explainaccess.py -u /SASEnvironmentManager/dashboard
#
# 7. As 6. but including a header row and the create permission, which is relevant for services but not for folders and other objects
#        ./explainaccess.py -u /SASEnvironmentManager/dashboard --header -l read update delete secure add remove create
#
# 8. Explain direct and indirect permissions on a report, reducing the permissions reported to just read, update, delete and secure,
#    since none of add, remove or create are applicable to a report.
#        ./explainaccess.py -u /reports/reports/e2e0e601-b5a9-4601-829a-c5137f7441c6 --header -l read update delete secure
#
# 9. Explain direct and indirect permissions on a folder expressed as a URI. Keep the default permissions list, but for completeness
#    we must also specify -c true to request conveyed permissions be displayed, as they are not displayed by default for URIs.
#        ./explainaccess.py -u /folders/folders/9145d26a-2c0d-4523-8835-ad186bb57fa6 --header -p -c true
