## Examples

The example calls assume you are in the directory where you installed the tools. If you are not you can prepemd the directory to the filename, for example /opt/pyviyatools/callrestapi.py
If you are using the tool on windows the syntax is:

python toolname.py

The following examples are Linux.

**loginviauathinfo.py**

```bash
# Login to Viya using default authinfo file ~/.authinfo
./loginviauthinfo.py

# Login to Viya using an authinfo file
./loginviauthinfo.py -f ~/.authinfo_geladm
```

**callrestapi.py**

```bash

./callrestapi.py -e /folders -m get

#return the json for all the folders/folders
./callrestapi.py -e /folders/folders -m get

#return simple text for all the folders/folders
./callrestapi.py -e /folders/folders -m get -o simple

#rest calls often limit the results returned the text output will tell you returned and total available items
#in this call set a limit above the total items to see everything
./callrestapi.py -e /folders/folders?limit=500 -m get -o simple


#return the json for all the identities
./callrestapi.py -e /identities/identities -m get

#return the json for all the identities output to a file
./callrestapi.py -e /identities/identities -m get > identities.json

#refresh the identities cache
./callrestapi.py -e /identities/userCount -m get
./callrestapi.py -e /identities/cache/refreshes -m post

```

**getfolderid.py**

csv file format
no header row
column1 is userid
column2 is password
column3 is identity
column4 is identity type (user or group)

For example:
myuserid,mypass,Sales,group
acct1,pw1,sasadm,user

./callrestapi.py -e /credentials/domains/<newdomain> -m post -i domain.json

INPUT JSON must be formatted as the endpoint expects. Example:

{
  "id": "<newdomain>",

./explainaccess.py -u /reports/reports/id --header -l read update delete secure

#Explain direct and indirect permissions on a folder expressed as a URI. Keep the default permissions list, but for completeness we must also specify -c true to request conveyed permissions be displayed, as they are not displayed by default for URIs.
