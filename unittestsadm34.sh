# unittestsadm34.sh
# December 2018
#
# Calls each of the pyviyatools at least once, as a simple unit/integration test
#
# Some tests are provided with example folder paths which are not likely to
# exist in your deployment. However, most tests are not dependent on any
# custom content in the deployment, and will run well on any deployment.
#
# Some tests intentionally do things which do not work, e.g. delete a folder
# which does not exist. The error message returned by the tool called is
# considered sufficient to demonstrate that it has in fact been called, and is
# working as intended. If you like, you could create content for these tests
# to act on, e.g. create a folder called "/this_folder_does_not_exist", and
# allow one of the tests below delete it.
#
# The following tests create new content, and do not clean up after themselves:
# 1. "Create a domain using createdomain"
#    - creates or replaces domain named 'test', does not create multiple
#      copies
# 2. "Create a binary backup job"
#    - creates a new scheduled job named 'BINARY_BACKUP_JOB' each time it
#      runs, will create multiple copies
# You may wish to clean up after them manually, especially in a
# real customer environment. Study the tests and/or run them individually
# to learn more about what they create, so that you can find and delete it
# yourself. In a dev, PoC, playpen or classroom environment, the cleanup
# might be optional, as the created objects will not interfere with other
# content or work.
#
