# comparecontent.py
# Sep 2024
#
# This script compares two content files and reports the differences.
# It checks for a matching header line and lists content that is unique to each file.
# It is designed to be run from the command line with two file arguments.
# you can use it to compare the content of two runs of listcontent.py or liscaslib.py.
# Typically, you would run this script after making changes to content files to see what has changed.
# It uses the difflib module to find differences between the two files.
# usage: python comparecontent.py --file1 <path_to_file1> --file2 <path_to_file2> [--label1 <label1>] [--label2 <label2>] [-d|--debug]
